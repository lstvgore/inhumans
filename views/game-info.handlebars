    <h4>About the game</h4>
    <p>This is a murder mystery party game for 1-5 players. What a fun way to play with friends or solo set the scene in 1 of 5 planets. When the user clicks on the planet, a pop-up window will deploy to have you create your avatar, and then when all 5 players have entered the game the fun begins.</p>
